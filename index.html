                        <p class="p">My name is Zac and I am currently in Pharmaceutical Research but I am taking steps into changing careers. This is my portfolio and I am excited to share my journey into full stack development with you. Explore and let me know what you think! </p>
                        <p class="p">A little more about me… I am a member of a cult, ah I mean… Crossfit community. I am passionate about Crossfit and spend a lot of my free time training with other fit fanatics <i>{cough…}</i> cult members. Being active and trying to be healthy (except pizza night Saturdays) is a way of life for me. I love to be outdoors – camping, hiking, shooting, cycling, mowing the lawn, BBQing, sports of all kind, you get the picture. If it takes place outdoors, chances are, I will probably enjoy it. </p>
                        <p class="p">On the other hand, a great video game or gripping movie will keep me happy staying indoors. Knowing myself, I have to be careful not to get lost in virtual Tamriel, Middle Earth, or The Continent <i>(we're going to get along just fine if you know what these are referencing)</i>.</p>
